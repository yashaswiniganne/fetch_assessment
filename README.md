# Data Analyst Project for Fetch

This is a data analysis project for a company called Fetch. The project includes the following files:

EDA_01: This file contains the complete code for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which I wrote in a Colab environment.
questions&answers.ipynb: This file contains the questions and answers from the assessment.
Email_with_findings.txt: This file includes an email summarizing the findings from the project.
users_takehome.csv and transactions_takehome.csv: These are the raw CSV files with data related to users and transactions.
Please note, the file products_takehome.csv is missing due to its large file size.
